# Qt_5.15

Precompiled LGPL libs for Qt 5.15.2

See [supermodule](https://github.com/HunterVacui/qt_lgpl) for source and build instructions


Alternatively, download using QT Installer https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer

If using QT Installer, do not select any package that references "Licensing Available for Companies" or "GPL License".
  "QT Purchasing" and "QT Network Authorization" are the only two worthwhile optional packages that are available under LGPL

also do not include WebEngine (it's too big to fit on GitHub, because it includes its own Chromium build)
